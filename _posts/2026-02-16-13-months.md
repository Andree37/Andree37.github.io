What if every month had exactly 28 days? Same weekday on the 1st, every month, every year. No more checking if it's a 30 or 31 day month. No more "what day does my birthday fall on this year?"

That's the [International Fixed Calendar](https://www.13months.net/){:target="_blank"} — 13 months of 28 days, plus one extra day (Year Day) that sits outside the weekly cycle. Kodak actually ran on it for 61 years. It almost got adopted by the League of Nations in 1937.

I built a site so people could vote on the idea: **[13months.net](https://www.13months.net/){:target="_blank"}**

Convert your birthday, browse the full calendar, vote on whether you would use it or not, and see the results of the poll.
