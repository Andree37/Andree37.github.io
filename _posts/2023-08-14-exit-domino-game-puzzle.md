# Building the Exit Game Puzzle Solver: A Python Adventure

## Introduction

We've all been there: engrossed in a captivating exit game, faced with a puzzle that just won't yield its secrets. For me, that puzzle involved finding the last digit for a combination starting with the piece (1,3). After spending more time than I'd like to admit, I decided to let Python do the heavy lifting. This is the tale of the Exit Game Puzzle Solver.

## The Genesis of an Idea

Exit games, with their intricate puzzles and immersive narratives, have always fascinated me. But sometimes, the challenges can be... well, challenging. Faced with a particularly troublesome puzzle, I found myself yearning for a tool that could ease the strain on my brain.

Why not turn this frustration into a coding challenge? And so, the idea for the Exit Game Puzzle Solver was born.

## Script Mechanics: A Peek Under the Hood

At its core, the script accepts a starting piece, like (1,3), and computes the last digit required for the combination. While I won't delve into the exact mechanics of the puzzle-solving algorithm (no spoilers!), the user interface is worth discussing.

I wanted the script to be user-friendly, accepting command-line arguments for flexibility. The starting piece should be optional, defaulting to (1,3) if none is provided.

## Using argparse for Graceful Argument Handling

Python's argparse module was a natural choice to handle command-line arguments. It offers powerful functionality out of the box, including type checks, default values, and custom help messages.

Here's a snippet that sets this up:

```python
import argparse

def main():
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Solve exit game puzzles involving number combinations.")
parser.add_argument("piece", nargs="*", type=int, default=[1, 3], help="Initial piece of the combination (default: %(default)s)")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if len(args.piece) != 2:
        parser.error("Exactly two integers are required for the initial piece or omit to use the default.")

    initial_piece = tuple(args.piece)

    # Rest of the puzzle-solving logic

if __name__ == "__main__":
main()
```

Users can specify their initial piece as:

`python exit_game_solver.py 2 4`

Or use the default (1,3) by simply executing the script without arguments.

## Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead

The Exit Game Puzzle Solver turned a moment of gaming frustration into a rewarding coding experience. Not only did I get past my exit game hurdle, but I also flexed my Python muscles and created a tool that others might find useful.

The beauty of open-source is that this is just the beginning. With the [project now on GitHub](https://github.com/Andree37/exit-domino-finder), the community can contribute enhancements, expand its capabilities, or even adapt it for other types of puzzles.

Next time you're up against a tricky exit game puzzle, remember: Python might just have your back!
