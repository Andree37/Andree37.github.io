Deep Learning can be used for a lot of interesting projects and things. In this little study I've made, I will show how I trained a **Recurrent Neural Network** to create new text in the style of _William Shakespeare_.

I used [Keras][keras]{:target="_blank"} to help with development, but the same could be achieved with [NumPy][numpy]{:target="_blank"}. I use the former for quick development. If after this article you want to learn more I urge you to read [this great article][niklas donges]{:target="_blank"} from Niklas Donges.

## Recurrent Neural Network Model

![rnn unfolded](/posts/rnn-shakespeare/rnn-unfolded.png){: width="322" height="589" style="max-width: 90%" .right}

Although creating an RNN sounds complex, the implementation is pretty easy using [Keras][keras]{:target="_blank"}. The model RNN[^rnn] can be easily create with the following structure:
1. LSTM Layer
2. Dense (Fully Connected) Layer
3. Softmax Activation

The **LSTM Layer** will learn the sequence that it gathers from the text.
The **Dense Layer** allows for one output neuron for each unique char.
And the **Softmax Activation** transforms outputs to probability values.

To optimize the model gradients I used [RMSprop][rmsprop]{:target="_blank"} and the [Categorical Crossentropy Loss][categoricalloss]{:target="_blank"} function to calculate the quantity that a model should seek to minimze at each training timing.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation
from keras.layers import LSTM
from keras.optimizers import RMSprop

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars))))
model.add(Dense(len(chars)))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

optimizer = RMSprop(lr=0.01)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer)
```

## Helper Functions

Taking some inspiration from the official [LSTM text generation example][lstmexample]{:target="_blank"} from the Keras Team, I created two helper functions to see the improvements the model made whilst training.

```python
def sample(preds, temperature=1.0):
    # helper function to sample an index from a probability array
    preds = np.asarray(preds).astype('float64')
    preds = np.log(preds) / temperature
    exp_preds = np.exp(preds)
    preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
    probas = np.random.multinomial(1, preds, 1)
    return np.argmax(probas)

def on_epoch_end(epoch, logs):
    # Function invoked at end of each epoch. Prints generated text.
    print()
    print('----- Generating text after Epoch: %d' % epoch)

    start_index = random.randint(0, len(text) - maxlen - 1)
    for diversity in [0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2]:
        print('----- diversity:', diversity)

        generated = ''
        sentence = text[start_index: start_index + maxlen]
        generated += sentence
        print('----- Generating with seed: "' + sentence + '"')
        sys.stdout.write(generated)

        for i in range(400):
            x_pred = np.zeros((1, maxlen, len(chars)))
            for t, char in enumerate(sentence):
                x_pred[0, t, char_indices[char]] = 1.

            preds = model.predict(x_pred, verbose=0)[0]
            next_index = sample(preds, diversity)
            next_char = indices_char[next_index]

            generated += next_char
            sentence = sentence[1:] + next_char

            sys.stdout.write(next_char)
            sys.stdout.flush()
        print()
print_callback = LambdaCallback(on_epoch_end=on_epoch_end)
```

I also created two other callback functions to be called on a checkpoint in order to save the model each epoch there is a decrease in the **Loss**.

```python
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

filepath = "weights.hdf5"
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='loss',
                             verbose=1, save_best_only=True,
                             mode='min')
```

The other callback will reduce the learning rate each time the model's learning plateaus.

```python
from keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='loss', factor=0.2,
                              patience=1, min_lr=0.001)

callbacks = [print_callback, checkpoint, reduce_lr]
```

## Training the model and generating new Text

Here comes the exciting part!!!

All that we have to do is decide some parameters values, namely _batch size_, and _epochs_

```python
model.fit(x, y, batch_size=128, epochs=100, callbacks=callbacks)
```

Training output:

LOOK AT HIM WRITING BY ITSELF! AAAAAAAAAAA IT'S ALIVE! 🤖

All that is really left is to use a function to generate text similar to the _on_epoch_end_ function. It takes a random starting index, take out the next 40 chars from the text and then use them to make predictions. As a parameter it takes the length of the text we want to generate and the diversity of the generated text.

```python
def generate_text(length, diversity):
    # Get random starting text
    start_index = random.randint(0, len(text) - maxlen - 1)
    generated = ''
    sentence = text[start_index: start_index + maxlen]
    generated += sentence
    for i in range(length):
            x_pred = np.zeros((1, maxlen, len(chars)))
            for t, char in enumerate(sentence):
                x_pred[0, t, char_indices[char]] = 1.

            preds = model.predict(x_pred, verbose=0)[0]
            next_index = sample(preds, diversity)
            next_char = indices_char[next_index]

            generated += next_char
            sentence = sentence[1:] + next_char
    return generated
```

And we can create a 🤖 text by just calling the _generate_text_ function

```python
print(generate_text(500, 0.2))
```

Which gives us our initial text on top of the Page!

## Conclusion

Recurrent Neural Networks are a technique of working with sequential data, because they can remember the last inputs via an internal memory. They achieve state-of-the-art performance on pretty much every sequential problem and are used by most major companies. An RNN can be used to generate text in the style of a specific author.

I do believe a bit more of work could be done to make the model even more sophisticated. Perhaps the tweaking of the network structure (more LSTM-Dense Layers).

If you liked this Page I would recommend this [chapter][book]{:target="_blank"} to deepen your knowledge even further, and perhaps I got you excited in the future of artificial inteligence once again!
