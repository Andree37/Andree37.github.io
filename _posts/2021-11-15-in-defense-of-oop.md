## Motivation

**Object Oriented Programming** Some developers love it - others hate it.
*OOP* is a long-standing programming paradigm that addresses the importance of organizing your code into larger meaningful objects that model the parts of your problem.

This sometimes represents what the people actually think in the real world, arranging their code into meaningful chunks with relationships that are obvious and intuitive.

But in practice, some people say, OOP doesn't always work out this way. I want to address this issue and come to defend the importance of OOP and instead shift this hatred towards over-engineering.
