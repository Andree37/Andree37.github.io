## whoami

My name is **André Ribeiro**, I am a first year Master student in Computer Science and Engineering at [Instituto Superior Técnico][tecnico]{:target="_blank"}. I have professional experience working with web and mobile development and am currently Specializing in Distributed Systems and Data Science in my masters where I have also done some work (both professionally and personal) with NLP, Emotion Detection, Scene Recognition and Object Detection models as part of my Data Science background.

***
Personally enjoy making small projects in my free time that allow me to learn and participating in *Hackathons* where I can put my skills to the test.


Bass player and wish one day to fully learn this song:
