## whoami

My name is **AndrÃ© Ribeiro**, I am a first year Master student in [Computer Science and Engineering][masters]{:target="_blank"} at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico][tecnico]{:target="_blank"}. I have professional experience creating backend applications, AI solutions at companies like [Lisgo][lisgo]{:target="_blank"} and [Amazon][amazon]{:target="_blank"}.

I'm currently Specializing in Distributed Systems and Data Science in my masters.


***
I enjoy making small projects in my free time that allow me to learn, and also participate in *Hackathons* where I can put my skills to the test even if it's all the way [across the globe][australianhackathon]{:target="_blank"}.

And my absolute favorite language is ðŸ¦€Rust ðŸ¦€


Bass player and wish one day to fully learn this song:
