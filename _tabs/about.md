## whoami

My name is **AndrÃ© Ribeiro**, I am the Co-founder of [Quasarch][quasarch]{:target="_blank"}, a Descentralized cloud provider and a finalist Master student in [Computer Science and Engineering][masters]{:target="_blank"} at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico][tecnico]{:target="_blank"} currently researching my thesis on Symbolic Execution in partnership with [OutSystems][outsystems]{:target="_blank"}. 

I have professional experience creating backend applications and AI solutions at companies like [Amazon][amazon]{:target="_blank"} and [Lisgo][lisgo]{:target="_blank"}.

***
I enjoy making small projects in my free time that allow me to learn, and also participate in *Hackathons* where I can put my skills to the test even if it's all the way [across the globe][australianhackathon]{:target="_blank"}.

My absolute favorite language is ðŸ¦€RustðŸ¦€
